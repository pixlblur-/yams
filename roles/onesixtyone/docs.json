  "description": "The approach taken by most SNMP scanners is to send the request, wait for n seconds and assume that the community string is invalid. If only 1 of every hundred scanned IP addresses responds to the SNMP request, the scanner will spend 99*n seconds waiting for replies that will never come. This makes traditional SNMP scanners very inefficient.\n\nonesixtyone takes a different approach to SNMP scanning. It takes advantage of the fact that SNMP is a connectionless protocol and sends all SNMP requests as fast as it can. Then the scanner waits for responses to come back and logs them, in a fashion similar to Nmap ping sweeps.",
